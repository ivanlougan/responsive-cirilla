          A professional monster hunter and the series' protagonist. Known as
          the "White Wolf," he is a skilled swordsman and alchemist, with white
          hair and cat-like eyes due to Witcher mutations. Geralt is stoic,
          pragmatic, and deeply moral beneath his gruff exterior.
